- Hey, I’m Michael Han, a 9th grader in the Boston area. I’m looking for an Academic Research Assistant or Internship opportunity.

- I have been programming using Python, Java, and JavaScript for five years and I’m experienced in using Latex, and HTML/CSS. I have also qualified for AIME(American Invitational Mathematics Examination) since 6th grade.

- I was accepted into the MIT PRIMES STEP research program in 7th/9th grade and published a paper about Latin Squares. I have also achieved the Honor Roll in the AMC10 and Distinguished Honor Roll in AMC8 in 6th grade. I also took the MOEMS and received a perfect score along with the George Lenchner Award.

- I have reached the USACO(USA Computing Olympiad) Silver level since 6th grade. I also achieved a near perfect score at the ACSL(American Computer Science League).

- I’m working as a Teacher Assistant at KTBYTE Computer Science Academy and worked as an instructor at 7th and 8th Summer Fun Math Camp. I enjoy reading, playing basketball, biking and coding in my free time.
